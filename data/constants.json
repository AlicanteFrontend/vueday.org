How does Vue realize that a data has changed in the most remote part of an array and update \"automagically\" the values that depend on it? Does this system have limits?",

In some Angular-like frameworks it is resolved, but when we do not use any framework or we work with some more like Vue, React or Preact we have to import our dependencies on different ways.
