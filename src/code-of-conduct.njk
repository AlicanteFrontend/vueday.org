    <h1>Code of conduct</h1>

    <h2><span>1.</span> Purpose</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Vue Day</strong> is a non-profit conference organized by
      <a href="{{alicanteFrontend.url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alicante Frontend</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this conference is to share knowledge and disseminate about web development,
      especially everything related to
      <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vue.js</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A primary objective of this conference is to be inclusive with the largest number of
      collaborators, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic
      conditions and religion (or lack of it).
    </p>

    <p>
      This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in this event,
      as well as the consequences of unacceptable behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      We invite all those who participate in Vue Day to help us create a safe and positive
      experience for all.
    </p>

    <h2><span>2.</span> Civics in open source</h2>

    <p>
      A complementary goal of this code of conduct is to increase citizenship in the open source
      community, encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between
      our actions and their effects in our community.
    </p>

    <p>
      The topics within the community are related to the field of frontend development and the IT
      sector, if one or a member of the community could feel violent because of a topic that has
      nothing to do with the development or the sector of the computer science, and asked to
      redirect the conversation, would return to the subjects planned in the agenda of the day.
      Only the #random channel of Slack will be used for more transversal topics and always
      complying with the rest of the points of this code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Active or passive participation in group activities are optional and do not entail
      obligation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any person who decides to speak, may do so provided that he / she is respecting the opinions
      of others and complying with the rest of the points of this code of conduct.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you see someone who is making a major effort to help make our community welcoming,
      friendly and encourage all participants to contribute the most, we want to know.
    </p>

    <h2><span>3.</span> Expected behavior</h2>

    <p>The following behaviors are expected and requested by all the members of the community:</p>

      notify a community organizer.
    </p>

    <p>
      When contacting, indicate the name of the event and in which part of the facility the
      violation of the code of conduct is occurring, and briefly explain the nature of the
      incident.

    <h2><span>8.</span> Scope</h2>

      code of conduct in all areas of the community -real and virtual-, as well as in all personal
      communications related to community matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code of conduct and its related procedures also apply to unacceptable behaviors that
