      <summary>Last year entrance was free, why not this year?</summary>
      <p>We've decided to increase the number of attendees, opt for a venue with better conditions and give a better experience to the attendees in every possible way. The income generated by the event is solely and exclusively for investment in the event and Alicante Frontend activities. Alicante Frontend has never profited from any of its activities and this is not an exception.</p>
